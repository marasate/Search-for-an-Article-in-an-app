# Search-for-an-Article-in-an-app
Python program to search for an article in application. Data structure used is TRIE. 
Explanation of the algorithm
Autofill is a feature of suggesting possible extensions to a partially written text and is widely used in search engine.

Trie Data Structure
TRIE Data Structure also known as the Prefix Tree or Radix Tree is remarked as an excellent Data Structure for processing and storing the Strings and is primarily used for word retrieval.

 1- The nodes in the TRIE Data Structure are used for storing the associate keys of strings and values that are being 
    stored in the TRIE.
 2- TRIE Data Structure so optimized for performing Autofill.
 3- Unlike the popular Binary Trees, each node in TRIE can contain a maximum of 26 nodes which are pointers to the 26       
    different alphabets of English Language.
 4- The position of each node in a TRIE defines the key with which the node is associated.
 5- This makes the TRIE indexing suitable for maintaining the variable sized key values. The actual key values is never    
    stored but the key values are implied through links. A TRIE of Order 26 can maintain a whole English dictionary.
