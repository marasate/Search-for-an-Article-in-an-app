# ### Explanation of the algorithm
#  
# <b>Autofill</b> is a feature of suggesting possible extensions to a partially written text and is widely used in search engine. 
# 
# ### Trie Data Structure
# 
# TRIE Data Structure also known as the Prefix Tree or Radix Tree is remarked as an excellent Data Structure for processing and storing the Strings and is primarily used for word retrieval.
# 
#      1- The nodes in the TRIE Data Structure are used for storing the associate keys of strings and values that are being 
#         stored in the TRIE.
#      2- TRIE Data Structure so optimized for performing Autofill.
#      3- Unlike the popular Binary Trees, each node in TRIE can contain a maximum of 26 nodes which are pointers to the 26       
#         different alphabets of English Language.
#      4- The position of each node in a TRIE defines the key with which the node is associated.
#      5- This makes the TRIE indexing suitable for maintaining the variable sized key values. The actual key values is never    
#         stored but the key values are implied through links. A TRIE of Order 26 can maintain a whole English dictionary.
#

# ### (NB)try to write well documented & clean code as much as possible and explain the complexity O(n) of your code as a whole.
#        
#        If tried with other data structures the complexity of the list would be  
#         List-> O(NM) where N is the number of words in list and M is the length of each word
#         Binary search Tree -> O(Mlogn) where n is the number of words and M is the length of each word
#  
# Therefore,
#            With Trie, find <h4>The Best Case Time Complexity has been described as O(1) while the Average and Worst Case is described as O(Length-Of-Key).</h4> 
#            time where N represent the length of a single word.
#            This is obviously faster than BST. 
#            This is also faster than Hashing because of the ways it is implemented. 
#            We do not need to compute any hash function. No collision handling is required 
#            Another advantage of Trie is, we can easily print all words in alphabetical order which is not easily possible with              hashing. We can efficiently do prefix search (or auto-complete) with Trie.
#         
#         
# Note: The total explanation has been given above.

# ### Bonus: Can you describe the limitations(if it has any) of your code?
# 
#         No code or say data structures considered to be the best. A code or the data structure can be efficient. According     
#         to me, this is the efficient code in terms of time complexity. 
#         
#         But there are few limitations with this data structure.
# 
# Limitation 1:
#         The main disadvantage of Tries is that they need a lot of memory for storing the strings. For each node we 
#         have too many node pointers(equal to number of characters of the alphabet).
#         
#         
# 
# Limitation 2: 
#         The search results in only 3 outputs which could mean that the user might not find the required magazine.
#         Also, Considering the alphabetically sorted output, the user desired output will not be seen to user's eye.
#         
#         for example:
#         A user searches for the magazine beginning with "az" which could be in the 40th position, which will be a hectic task   
#         for the user to look into all the searchs ->  the solution to this is given in below section  "How could we improve our 
#         autocomplete service"
#         
# Limitation 3:
#         If there is an error in the spelling of a magazine then the code retuns "Nothing" and that could impact the sales or 
#         views of the magazine, which is of high probability.
#         
#         for example:
#         list = ["Cultures Marines", "Cuisine Revue", "Cuisine a & d"] 
#         if a user wants "Cuisine a & d" magazine, but he searches as "kui" instead of "cui" then the code will return nothing. 
# 
#         
# ### Is it scalable?
# 
#         Yes, it is scalable. The code is written in the class section and the required changes can be made by calling that 
#         particular method from the class, from anywhere. So it is easily accessed, modified and upgraded with few lines of 
#         codes.
#         
# ### How could we improve our autocomplete service?
#   
#         An efficient question to answer, 
#         
# Improvements could be done:
# 
# suggestion 1 for limitation one:     
#         If space is concerned, then the alternate could be, Ternary Search Tree can be peferred for dictionary implementations.
#         The time complexity is not better than trie, which is O(h) where h is the height of the tree, but not better than the 
#         Trie.
# 
# suggestion 2 for limitation 2:
#         When a user searches for a particular magazine for the first time, then it is highly likely that the user would want the 
#         same result to be shown at the top. If there is a hit on one particular magazine then that particular magazine name must 
#         be shown at the top by using machine learning and probabiltity that the user might want to search the same magazine.
#         
#         for example:        
#         list = ["Cultures Marines", "Cuisine Revue",......, "Cuisine a & d",............] list of 100 magazines.
#         if a user wants "Cuisine a & d" and searches "cu" then the required magazine will be at 30th postion 
#         
#         Next time -> if a user searches "cu", the required output "Cuisine a & d" must be shown at the top, for the ease of 
#         access.
#         
# suggestion 3 for limitation 3:
#         For the limitation 3, it would be very useful to use something like compact Trie data structure along with deep learning 
#         and probability to give the predicted output by estimating other characters of a word.
#         
#         For example: 
#         
#         list = ["Cultures Marines", "Cuisine Revue", "Cuisine a & d"] 
#         if a user wants "Cuisine a & d" magazine, but he searches as "kuis" instead of "cuis" then the code should return these 
#         possible output matching with second, third and fourth postion.
#         
#         to not get the large amount of output we can give a constraint like, 
#         if 3 or more characters matches then return the other possible answers.
#         
#
